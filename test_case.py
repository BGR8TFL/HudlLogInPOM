"""
test_case.py:

This module has test cases that are run using Page Object Model (POM) for the Hudl website login functionality. Test cases cover the following scenarios:

- Verification of login page.
- Prevent Login with incorrect credentials, display and validate error message.
- Successful login, access to the home page and other verifications ensuring correct user is logged in.

Tests designed to be run using PyTest and are dependent on "conf.py" file for configuration, "conftest.py" for settings and fixtures, "locators.py" file for locators and "pages" package for page functions.

Each test case has its own docstring outlining the scenario it covers and the expected behavior.
